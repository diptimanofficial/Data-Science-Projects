# Game Sales Data Science Project — Step-by-Step Guide

This project uses real Steam data to analyze how game price, player ownership, and engagement metrics relate to one another. Using both linear and log-log regression models, the project identifies which relationships are strongest, evaluates model performance through visualizations, and generates a prediction scenario for a major game release (GTA 6).

## This step includes:
- Data cleaning
- Regression modeling (linear + log-log)
- Visualization of predictions and residuals
- Exported regression coefficients
- A GTA 6 forecast Excel file
